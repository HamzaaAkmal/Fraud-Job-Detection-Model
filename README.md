## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model for detecting fraudulent job postings. In today's digital age, online job platforms are a primary target for scammers. These fraudulent postings can mislead job seekers, waste their time, and potentially expose them to financial risks.

Leveraging a dataset of job advertisements, this solution employs natural language processing (NLP) techniques combined with traditional machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious patterns. The core of the model utilizes TF-IDF for text feature extraction and a Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) for classification. The project demonstrates a complete workflow from data understanding and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and persistence for future use.

## Project Structure and Components

The project is structured into several Python classes within the `classes.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, each handling a specific part of the data science pipeline:

*   **`Data` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** Handles the initial loading of the `jobs.csv` dataset and provides basic data exploration methods (e.g., `head()`, `shape()`, `info()`, `describe()`).
    *   **Key Functionality:** Provides fundamental insights into the dataset's structure, dimensions, data types, and summary statistics.

*   **`DataPreprocessing` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** Focuses on cleaning and preparing the raw data for model training.
    *   **Key Functionality:**
        *   Identifies and handles missing values (e.g., dropping rows with missing `description`, filling others with placeholders like 'Not Provided' or statistical measures like median/mode).
        *   Performs feature engineering by creating new informative features from existing text fields (e.g., text lengths, count of specific characters like '$' or '!', presence of common scam keywords).
        *   Saves the cleaned and engineered dataset to a new CSV file (`phase1cleaned.csv`).

*   **`Graph`, `UnivariateAnalysis`, `BivariateAnalysis` Classes:**
    *   **Purpose:** Dedicated to exploratory data analysis (EDA) through various visualizations.
    *   **`Graph`:** A base class providing individual plotting methods for different aspects of the data.
    *   **`UnivariateAnalysis`:** Inherits from `Graph` and aggregates methods for plotting distributions of single variables (e.g., `fraudulent` job distribution, `employment_type` distribution, `required_education` levels).
    *   **`BivariateAnalysis`:** Inherits from `Graph` and provides methods for visualizing relationships between two variables (e.g., average salary vs. location, employment type vs. fraudulent status, fraudulent jobs by industry).

*   **`Model` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** Encapsulates the core machine learning pipeline, including feature encoding, data splitting, model training, and evaluation.
    *   **Key Functionality:**
        *   **Feature Encoding:** Combines relevant text fields into a single 'text' column and applies TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text into numerical features. Integrates other numerical features like `telecommuting`, `has_company_logo`, and `has_questions`.
        *   **Data Splitting:** Divides the processed data into training and testing sets (80/20 split) using stratified sampling to ensure the target variable's class distribution is maintained.
        *   **Model Training:** Trains a `LinearSVC` (Linear Support Vector Classifier) from `sklearn.svm`, known for its effectiveness in text classification.
        *   **Model Evaluation:** Assesses the model's performance using standard metrics: confusion matrix, classification report (precision, recall, F1-score), and accuracy.
        *   **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained `LinearSVC` model and the `TfidfVectorizer` object using Python's `pickle` module for later use.

*   **`PickleModel` Class:**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a convenient way to load the previously saved machine learning model and vectorizer to make predictions on new, unseen data.
    *   **Key Functionality:** Loads the `svm_fraud_model.pkl` file and offers a `predict()` method that prepares new data (combining text, vectorizing, stacking with other features) and generates predictions.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset of job postings, assumed to be named `jobs.csv`. This dataset contains various features describing job advertisements, including:

*   **Textual Features:** `title`, `description`, `requirements`, `benefits`, `company_profile`.
*   **Categorical Features:** `employment_type`, `required_experience`, `required_education`, `industry`, `function`, `location`, `department`.
*   **Numerical/Binary Features:** `salary_range` (converted to `salary_avg`), `telecommuting`, `has_company_logo`, `has_questions`.
*   **Target Variable:** `fraudulent` (a binary variable indicating whether a job posting is legitimate `0` or fraudulent `1`).

## Methodology

### Data Understanding & Loading

The initial step involves loading the `jobs.csv` dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The `Data` class is used to perform preliminary checks, such as:
*   Viewing the first few rows (`head()`) to understand the data format.
*   Checking the dimensions (`shape`) to know the number of rows and columns.
*   Getting a concise summary of the DataFrame (`info()`) to inspect data types and non-null counts.
*   Generating descriptive statistics (`describe()`, `describe_all()`) for numerical and categorical columns.

### Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

The `DataPreprocessing` class implements crucial steps to prepare the data:

*   **Handling Missing Values:**
    *   Rows with missing `description` are dropped, as this is a vital text field for fraud detection.
    *   Other missing text fields (`company_profile`, `requirements`, `benefits`) are filled with 'Not Provided'.
    *   `salary_range` is processed to extract `salary_avg` (by taking the average of the range if available, otherwise filled with the median salary). The original `salary_range` column is then dropped.
    *   Other categorical columns (`location`, `department`, `employment_type`, `required_experience`, `required_education`, `industry`, `function`) are filled with their respective modes.
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   New numerical features are engineered from text columns:
        *   `desc_length`, `req_length`, `benefits_length`, `title_length`, `profile_length`: The character lengths of the respective text fields.
        *   `desc_dollar_count`, `desc_exclaim_count`: The number of dollar signs and exclamation marks in the job description, often indicators of suspicious language.
        *   `has_scam_words`: A binary indicator (0 or 1) if the description contains common scam-related phrases (e.g., 'money', 'investment', 'fast cash', 'work from home', 'no experience', 'quick earn').

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The `Graph`, `UnivariateAnalysis`, and `BivariateAnalysis` classes are used to visualize the data and uncover patterns:

*   **Univariate Analysis:**
    *   **Fraudulent Job Distribution:** Shows a significant class imbalance, with a much larger number of legitimate jobs compared to fraudulent ones. This is a common challenge in fraud detection.
    *   **Employment Type Distribution:** Visualizes the most common employment types.
    *   **Required Experience/Education:** Displays the distribution of required experience levels and education backgrounds.
    *   **Telecommuting/Company Logo/Questions:** Shows the counts of remote jobs, jobs with company logos, and jobs requiring screening questions. (e.g., fraudulent jobs often lack company logos or are remote).
    *   **Top Industries/Job Functions/Locations:** Highlights the most frequent industries, job functions, and geographical locations.
*   **Bivariate Analysis:**
    *   **Average Salary by Location:** Illustrates how average salary varies across top locations.
    *   **Employment Type vs. Fraudulent:** Breaks down fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent counts by employment type, revealing if certain types are more prone to fraud.
    *   **Fraud by Industry:** Pinpoints which industries have the highest counts of fraudulent job postings.

### Model Development

The `Model` class orchestrates the machine learning pipeline:

*   **Combined Text Feature:** A new 'text' column is created by concatenating `title`, `description`, `requirements`, `benefits`, and `company_profile`. This comprehensive text field is central to the NLP approach.
*   **TF-IDF Vectorization:** `TfidfVectorizer` is applied to the combined 'text' column. This technique transforms text into a matrix of numerical TF-IDF features, representing the importance of words in the document relative to the corpus. `max_features` is set to 50,000 to limit the vocabulary size.
*   **Feature Stacking:** The TF-IDF features are horizontally stacked (`hstack`) with other numerical/binary features (`telecommuting`, `has_company_logo`, `has_questions`) to create the final feature matrix `X`.
*   **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`. Crucially, `stratify=self.y` is used to ensure that the proportion of fraudulent jobs is maintained in both training and testing sets, addressing the class imbalance. `random_state=42` ensures reproducibility.
*   **Model Training:** A `LinearSVC` (Linear Support Vector Classifier) is trained on the `X_train` and `y_train` data. `LinearSVC` is suitable for large datasets and linear classification tasks, making it a good choice for TF-IDF features. `max_iter` is increased to 10,000 to ensure convergence.

### Model Evaluation

After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the unseen `X_test` data:

*   **Confusion Matrix:** Provides a breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications (True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives).
*   **Classification Report:** Offers detailed metrics for each class:
    *   **Precision:** The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
    *   **Recall (Sensitivity):** The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
    *   **F1-score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
*   **Accuracy Score:** The overall proportion of correctly classified instances.

## Results

**Model Performance Summary:**

Based on the provided output, the `LinearSVC` model demonstrates strong performance in detecting fraudulent job postings:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      1.00      0.99      3403
           1       0.99      0.78      0.87       173

    accuracy                           0.99      3576
   macro avg       0.99      0.89      0.93      3576
weighted avg       0.99      0.99      0.99      3576

Accuracy: 0.9890939597315436
```

*   **Overall Accuracy:** Approximately **98.9%**. This high accuracy indicates that the model correctly classifies a large majority of job postings.
*   **Fraudulent Class (Class 1) Performance:**
    *   **Precision (0.99):** When the model predicts a job is fraudulent, it is correct 99% of the time. This is excellent for minimizing false alarms.
    *   **Recall (0.78):** The model identifies 78% of all actual fraudulent job postings. While not perfect, this is a respectable recall, indicating it catches a significant portion of fraud.
    *   **F1-score (0.87):** A strong F1-score for the minority class suggests a good balance between precision and recall in identifying fraud.

These results indicate that the model is highly effective in differentiating between legitimate and fraudulent job postings, making it a valuable tool for enhancing job platform security.

## Conclusion & Future Work

This project successfully developed a robust fraud detection model capable of classifying job postings with high accuracy. The combination of domain-specific feature engineering, TF-IDF for text representation, and a powerful LinearSVC classifier proved effective in handling the complexity and imbalanced nature of the dataset. The model's high precision for the fraudulent class ensures that legitimate job postings are rarely misflagged, which is crucial for user experience on job platforms.

**Future Work and Potential Improvements:**

1.  **Advanced NLP Techniques:**
    *   **Word Embeddings:** Explore pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to capture more nuanced semantic relationships in text. This could improve the model's understanding of job descriptions.
    *   **Deep Learning Models:** Experiment with recurrent neural networks (RNNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), or transformer-based models for text classification.

2.  **Addressing Class Imbalance:**
    *   While stratification was used, further techniques like **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** or **undersampling** of the majority class could be explored to balance the training data more effectively.
    *   Experiment with different **cost-sensitive learning** approaches within the model (e.g., adjusting class weights in LinearSVC).

3.  **More Feature Engineering:**
    *   **External Data:** Incorporate external data sources related to company reputation, domain registrations, or known scam patterns.
    *   **URL Features:** If job postings include URLs, extract features like domain age, URL length, presence of suspicious keywords in the URL, etc.
    *   **Geolocation Analysis:** Analyze `location` more deeply, perhaps using external geographical data to identify high-risk areas.

4.  **Model Optimization:**
    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find the optimal parameters for the LinearSVC or any other chosen model.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Explore ensemble techniques like Bagging, Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), or Stacking to combine multiple models for improved performance and generalization.

5.  **Interpretability:**
    *   Implement methods to understand *why* the model makes certain predictions (e.g., SHAP values, LIME) to gain insights into the key indicators of fraud.

By continuously refining the model and exploring advanced techniques, the accuracy and reliability of fraud detection systems can be further enhanced, protecting job seekers and maintaining the integrity of online platforms.
